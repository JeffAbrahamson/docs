Run your node programs
----------------------

You can run your scripts as usual. However, biicode has a script to execute node.js programs, just execute ``noderunner <block_name>/<script_name>`` inside the ``bin`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

	 ~$ cd bin
	 ~/bin$ noderunner <block_name>/<script_name>

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/<project_name>$ cd blocks/<block_name>
   ~/<project_name>/blocks/<block_name>$ #execute your script
