Raspberry Pi Cross Compilation 
==============================

This example shows **how to install biicode, code a C++ led blink with WiringPi, make the cross compilation and send the executable to your Raspberry Pi**. You don't need to have WiringPi installed in your computer or the rpi. Biicode will download and configure it automatically for you.

You will learn how to use the ``wiringpi.h`` file of the ``wiringpi/wiringpi`` block owner of ``drogon`` with the code line ``#include "drogon/wiringpi/wiringpi/wiringpi.h"``.

1. Installing biicode and C/C++ cross compilation tools
-------------------------------------------------------

.. container:: infonote

    **Debian linux distribution required**

    You need to use a native debian linux or in a virtual machine because the cross compilation tools needs it.

To reuse code, you need to install biicode and a group of external tools.

   - Download the biicode installer.

   - Execute ``bii setup:rpi`` in your console and all the C/C++ cross compilation tools will be installed automatically.

.. code-block:: bash

   ~$ bii setup:rpi

.. container:: infonote

    If you encounter any problem installing the C/C++ cross compilation tools, you can see :ref:`how to install C/C++ cross compilation tools manually <cpp_installation>`

2. Create your project
----------------------

To create a new project running ``bii init`` with the project name as a parameter.

.. code-block:: bash

   ~$ bii init rpi_hello_project

This command will create the following layout:

.. code-block:: text

   |-- rpi_hello_project
   |    +-- bii
   |    +-- blocks
   |    +-- deps

Now, we will create a block. a block is the place where you must place your code. Execute ``bii new anonymous/my_fist_block`` into the project folder to create a block.

.. code-block:: bash

   ~$ cd rpi_hello_project
   ~/rpi_hello_project$ bii new anonymous/my_first_block --hello=cpp

This command will create the following layout:

.. code-block:: text

   +-- rpi_hello_project
   |    +-- bii
   |    +-- blocks
   |    |    +-- anonymous
   |    |    |    +-- my_first_block
   |    |    |    |    +-- main.cpp
   |    +-- deps

.. container:: infonote

    **What is the reason behind this layout?**

    This layout is enforced because biicode analyzes the dependencies of your blocks and downloads them into de deps folder. It is important because biicode configures and build your project following this layout.

    For this reason, all the code you want to be analyzed must be placed into a block inside the blocks folder.

    The structure of these blocks is composed by two parts, the owner (username) and the block name. In this example we use an anonymous user, but if you want to publish your own blocks in the future, you will need to register and user your username.

    If you want to change the user of a block into your blocks folder, just change the name of the owner folder where this block lies.


3. Resolve your dependencies and send your executable to your Raspberry Pi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, edit your main.cpp file with the following code and execute ``bii find``. With this command, all your dependencies will be downloaded.

**main.cpp**

.. code-block:: cpp
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   #include "drogon/wiringpi/wiringpi/wiringpi.h"
   #define LED 0
   int main (void){
       wiringPiSetup () ;
       pinMode (LED, OUTPUT) ;
       digitalWrite (LED, HIGH) ; // On
   }

.. code-block:: bash

   ~/rpi_hello_project$ bii find

Now you are ready to compile and deploy your new application. First, **cross-compile your program** and make sure the binary is generated running ``bii cpp:build`` from your project location:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii cpp:build
	...
	Configuring cross compiler for ARM architecture:
	...
	[100%] Built target username_hello_rpi_main

The binaries are created in ``bin`` folder, but remember that **you cannot run this program locally, as it has been compiled for a different architecture** using the cross-compiling tools. You need to send the binary to your Raspberry Pi before executing it.

To **send the binary to your Raspberry Pi**, you just need to execute the ``bii rpi:send`` command and the file will be sent using `rsync <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync>`_ to the address provided in your settings.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii rpi:send
	Sending with rsync -Pravdtze ssh [PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/bin/* [RPI_USER]@[RPI_IP]:[DIRECTORY]/[PROJECT_NAME]

	[RPI_USER]@[RPI_IP]'s password:

The Raspberry Pi user's password will be asked. If you have not changed your password, for Raspbian the default one is **raspberry**.

Finally, to **execute your program on your Raspberry Pi**, you need to establish a connection. You can use the ``rpi:ssh`` command if you want remote access. You'll find your program deployed in the path configured in your settings:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii rpi:ssh
	...
	Connecting with ssh <rpi_user>@<rpi_ip>
	<rpi_user>@<rpi_ip>'s password:

	pi@raspberrypi ~ $ cd hello_rpi
	pi@raspberrypi ~/hello_rpi $ ls
	username_hello_rpi_main
	pi@raspberrypi ~/hello_rpi $ ./username_hello_rpi_main
	Hello world!

And that's all. Your program is working!
