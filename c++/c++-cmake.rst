CMake with biicode
==================

To create executables, static libraries or IDE projects, biicode uses CMake cross-platform tool. With CMake, you can use different compilers and standardize how you access the different resources available locally on your computer.

Biicode reports to CMake both: 

   #. The source code subsets it needs to generate the results grouping by blocks.
   #. The links among blocks specified by dependencies.

Biicode and CMake communicate through sets of variables available at CMake's disposal by a set of macros generated by biicode.
