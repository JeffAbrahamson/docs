Google Test Tutorial
====================

This example uses the famous library `googletest, a Google C++ Testing Framework <http://code.google.com/p/googletest/>`_. If you are familiar with coding in C++, you probably know about this library and use it for testing your projects. Otherwise, you can learn more visiting the `googletest project Wiki page <http://code.google.com/p/googletest/w/list>`_.

In this example **we are going to create a factorial function and a test for it**. This video shows the whole process described below:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/7763.js" id="asciicast-7763" async></script>


1. Create a new project
-------------------------

Create a new project as described in the :ref:`hello world example <cpp_getting_started>`.

2. Create a function and a test for it
---------------------------------------

We will start with a math example: a **simple function to calculate the factorial of an integer number**, which returns

* -1 if the number is negative,
* 1 if the number is zero, or
* the factorial if the number is positive, *(num)\*(num-1)\*(num-2)\*â€¦\*1*.

Put these files inside ``YOUR_WORKSPACE/gtest_project/blocks/YOUR_USERNAME/factorial``

**math_ext.h**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/math_ext.h
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

**math_ext.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/math_ext.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

**Download all the files:** :download:`math_ext.cpp </_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/math_ext.cpp>` :download:`math_ext.h </_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/math_ext.h>`
   
   
**Now than we have our factorial function, we can test it with Google Test**. You just have to include ``google/gtest/gtest.h``.
To check that the factorial function behaves as expected put main_test.cpp with the rest of source files:

**main_test.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/main_test.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

**Download the file:** :download:`main_test.cpp </_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/main_test.cpp>` 


3. Find dependencies
--------------------

Now **we have to ask biicode to find our dependencies**. This will download Google Test to your machine, into your project's ``deps`` folder.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii find
	INFO: Detected 3 files created, 0 updated
	...
	Find resolved new dependencies:
		google/gtest(google/master): 2
	All dependencies resolved
	...


4. Run your tests
-----------------

The final step is to actually compile and run the test. You can accomplish this task with the ``bii cpp:build`` command and run the executable inside the bin folder:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii cpp:build

	...

	$ cd bin
	$ #run test executable

Finally, we are ready to unit-test our factorial function:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii cpp:run test
	Building[ 77%] Built target google_gtest
	[100%] Built target username_factorial_main_test
	Running "username_factorial_main_test"
	Running main() from sample1
	[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.
	[----------] Global test environment set-up.
	[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
	[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.Negative
	[       OK ] FactorialTest.Negative (0 ms)
	[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.Zero
	[       OK ] FactorialTest.Zero (0 ms)
	[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.Positive
	[       OK ] FactorialTest.Positive (0 ms)
	[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (0 ms total)

	[----------] Global test environment tear-down
	[==========] 3 tests from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
	[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
	

5. Creating test suites
------------------------

If you want to have multiple test classes and run them all toghether you don't need to create multiple main methods, you just have to indicate which tests you want to include in your suite. For example, we can split the ``main_test.cpp`` in the following three files:

**test_factorial1.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/test_factorial1.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

**test_factorial2.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/test_factorial2.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

**main_test2.cpp**

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/cpp/examples/google-test-tutorial/main_test2.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :linenos:

Notice the tag comment ``// bii:#dependencies(+ test_factorial1.cpp test_factorial2.cpp)`` in the main file.
This is telling biicode that the main file depends on those test files. You can read more about dependeny tags :ref:`here <bii_dependencies_tag>`.

Now when we execute your tests we obtain exactly the same output:

.. code-block:: bash

	Running "username_my_gtest_main_test2"
	Running main() from sample1
	[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.
	[----------] Global test environment set-up.
	[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest
	[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.Negative
	[       OK ] FactorialTest.Negative (0 ms)
	[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.Zero
	[       OK ] FactorialTest.Zero (0 ms)
	[ RUN      ] FactorialTest.Positive
	[       OK ] FactorialTest.Positive (0 ms)
	[----------] 3 tests from FactorialTest (0 ms total)
	
	[----------] Global test environment tear-down
	[==========] 3 tests from 1 test case ran. (0 ms total)
	[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.


You can aggregate as many tests as you want to a suite so you can organize your tests to fit your needs.
