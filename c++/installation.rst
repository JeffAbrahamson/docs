Installation
============

This section describes how to install, set up and verify some **tools needed for building C and C++ projects with biicode**. These tools are:

* a compiler, and
* `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ , used by biicode for managing the compilation process. 

Also, it is suggested installing some IDE for better management of your hives. Supported C++ IDEs are Eclipse, and Visual Studio C++ in Windows. However, it is up to you whether to install an IDe or not. If you do so, you will find additional instructions in the :ref:`IDE configuration section <ide-configuration>`.

The steps for the installation of these tools vary from one operaing system to another. Here you will find detailed instructions for your actual development platform.
