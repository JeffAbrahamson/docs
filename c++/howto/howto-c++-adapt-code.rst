Adapt your C/C++ code
=====================

Just copy and paste your code inside a new block.

If you need a specific configuration, include the CMake files with the configuration of your block.

.. code-block:: bash

	#Create a new block
	$ bii new anonymous/my_name_block

	(copy and paste yours file into blocks/anonymous/my_name_block folder)

	#Test if your block compiles
	$ bii cpp:build
