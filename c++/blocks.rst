What is a block?
----------------

**A block** (also known as 'repo' or 'repository') is the place to put your code in biicode. 

Each block has an *owner, name, version* and *tag*. For example, the |openssl_link| block has an **owner** (lasote) and latest version is **3 DEV**.

Here's an example block structure:

.. code-block:: text

  +-- block_name/
  |   +-- src/
  |   |   +-- main.cpp
  |   +-- test/
  |   |   +-- test1.cpp 
  |   +-- biicode.conf
  |   +-- CMakeLists.txt
  |   +-- README

These are the main components of a block (under the ``block_name/`` directory):

  - Your repo's code, with its sources and folders.
  - ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, to specify your build config.
  - ``biicode.conf`` file with information about your block and its dependencies.
  - a README

* :ref:`Building Configuration your own Block <cpp_building>`

Block's web view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you know, a block is where you place your code in biicode. Blocks available in the web are the ones you can depend on.

Take a look at blocks in a `profile main page <https://www.biicode.com/examples>`_:

.. image:: /_static/img/c++/profile_view.png

As you see, blocks are organized in the web as ``owner/block_name`` too.

You can create a public or private block in the web by clicking on "Create block" and add directly a description.

.. image:: /_static/img/c++/create_block.png

Start working with the block you just created, type in your project folder:

.. code-block:: bash
 
  $ bii open owner/block_name

In the block's view you see the code, structure and information:

.. image:: /_static/img/c++/block_view.png

In the header you see:

  * **Block's name**
  * :ref:`Version<cpp_publishing>`
  * **Last time published**
  * **Description**: A brief description of the block. For longer description it's recommended to add a README file.
  * **Tags**: topics your block is related to.
  * **Settings**: Edit your block's settings by giving a description or tagging the block.

Below the header there are some tabs showing:

.. container:: tabs-section
    
    .. _block_web_tabs_code:
    .. container:: tabs-item

        .. rst-class:: tabs-title
            
            Code Browser

        This is the default view.
        You have the structure of your project and you can check the code or the files inside directories, as well as download all the block in a ZIP file.

    .. _block_web_tabs_requirements:
    .. container:: tabs-item

        .. rst-class:: tabs-title
            
            Block requirements

        This section shows blocks and versions your block depends on. You can view here the reuses of your block too.

        .. image:: /_static/img/c++/block_requirements.png

    .. _block_web_tabs_dependencies:
    .. container:: tabs-item

        .. rst-class:: tabs-title

           Block dependencies

        Block's dependencies of all kind: system, resolved and unresolved ones.

        .. image:: /_static/img/c++/block_dependencies.png

    .. _block_web_tabs_graph:
    .. container:: tabs-item

        .. rst-class:: tabs-title

            Dependencies graph

        Visual representation of block's dependencies.

        .. image:: /_static/img/c++/dependency_graph.png

biicode status badge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The biicode satus badge is a dynamically generated image displaying your block's latest published :ref:`version<cpp_publishing>` in biicode.

.. image:: /_static/img/c++/biicode_badge.png

This badge lets developers know your code is available to reuse at biicode. It is something determinant in the use of a dependency manager and you can place it in the *readme files* of your :ref:`VCS repository <git_integration>` and in the biicode block.

.. container:: infonote

 Get your badge in your block's **settings**.

Let people know your code can be reused easily!

Create a block from a git repository
------------------------------------

The code
^^^^^^^^

Put your code into a biicode block:

.. code-block:: bash

  $~ bii init project_name
  $~ cd project_name/blocks
  $~ mkdir username
  $~ cd username
  $~ git clone https://Your_Repo_URL.git

biicode.conf
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now execute ``bii deps`` or ``bii deps --files`` to get all information related to biicode's dependency scanning. This tells you all the unresolved ``#include``. 

Create a ``biicode.conf`` file and fill the ``[requirements]``,  and ``[includes]`` section to retrieve the libs you need (Box2D, OpenSSl, OpenCV, Libuv, GTest ...)

Also, write the ``[paths]`` section to tell biicode in which folders it has to look for the local files from your includes (You only need to specify this when your project has non-file-relative ``#include (s)``). 

* :ref:`More information on the biicode.conf file<biicode_conf>` and on :ref:`[paths] section<biicode_conf>`

This is an example of a biicode.conf file: ::

      # Biicode configuration file

      [requirements]
        # Blocks and versions this block depends on
        diego/glfw: 1
        lasote/openssl(v1.0.2): 0
        google/gtest: 9

      [parent]
        owner/block: 0

      [paths]
          # Local directories to look for headers (within block)
          include
          /

      [dependencies]
          # Manual adjust file implicit dependencies, add (+), remove (-), or overwrite (=)
          # hello.h + hello_imp.cpp hello_imp2.cpp
          # *.h + *.cpp

      [mains]
          # Manual adjust of files that define an executable
          # !main.cpp  # Do not build
          # main2.cpp # Build it

      [hooks]
          #  add (+), remove (-), or overwrite (=) files names matching bii*stage*hook.py
          # biicode launches them as python scripts at stage = {post_process, clean}
          # CMakeLists.txt + bii/my_post_process1_hook.py bii_clean_hook.py

      [includes]
          # Mapping of include patterns
          gtest/gtest.h: google/gtest/include/gtest
          GLFW/glfw3.h: diego/glfw/include
          openssl/.h: lasote/openssl/include

      [data]
          # Manually define data files dependencies, that will be copied to bin for execution
          # By default they are copied to bin/user/block/...
          # image.cpp + image.jpg  # code should write open("user/block/image.jpg")



CMakeLists.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* For projects with no ``CMakeLists.txt`` just execute ``bii cpp:build``. 
* Had a previous ``CMakeLists.txt``? Adapt it like this:

.. code-block:: cmake

   IF(BIICODE)
      INIT_BIICODE_BLOCK()    
      ADD_BIICODE_TARGETS()  
   ELSE()
      # Your regular CMakeLists configuration here
   ENDIF() 



* Follow this :ref:`Build Config Guide <cpp_building>` for specifics.

* There's also a post series explaining how to |upload_to_biicode|.
