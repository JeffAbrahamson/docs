C++ set up
==========

This section describes how to install, set up and verify some **tools needed for building C and C++ projects with biicode**. These tools are:

* a compiler,
* make, and
* `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ , used by biicode for managing the compilation process. 

Also, **it is suggested installing some IDE** for better management of your hives. Supported C++ IDEs are Eclipse, and Visual Studio C++ in Windows. However, it is up to you whether to install an IDE or not. If you do so, you will find additional instructions in the :ref:`IDE configuration section <ide_configuration>` of this documentation.

The steps for the installation of these tools vary from one operating system to another. Here you will find detailed instructions for your actual development platform.

1. Biicode initial setup
------------------------

First of all, **you need to complete the biicode general installation**. Follow :ref:`the instructions in the general documentation, following this link <first_steps>`. You must: 

* **Sign up** with biicode
* Download and install the **biicode installer** for your operating system
* Create a biicode **workspace**

**After** you have complete these steps, proceed with the following sections:

2. C++ tools installation
-------------------------
This section describes **how to configure your system for C/C++ programs with biicode.**

First, try the automatic installation provided by biicode. Only if something goes wrong, proceed with the manual installation described at the end of this section.

2.1 Automatic installation
..........................

**Just execute** ``bii setup:cpp`` in your console and all needed the C++ tools will be installed automatically.

		.. code-block:: bash

		   $ bii setup:cpp

Type the previous command and follow the instructions. You might need to close your console and open a new one to reload the updated environment variables. In the new console window, re-run the ``bii setup:cpp`` command to verify everything is properly installed.

**If something fails with the automatic installation**, please `contact us at our forum <http://forum.biicode.com/category/arduino>`__, and feel free to ask any questions. Then, **proceed with the alternative manual installation** described bellow.

2.2. Manual installation
........................

This section describes the manual installation of the C/C++ tools. You only need to go through this section if something failed during the automatic installation explained before. If you experience any issues during this manual installation, please `contact us at our forum <http://forum.biicode.com/category/raspberry-pi>`_, and we'll try to solve your problem as soon as possible.

.. container:: tabs-section
	 
	.. _cpp_desktop_linux:
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title
			
			Linux

		Install the required development tools as root:

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake

		That's all!

	.. _cpp_desktop_mac:
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title
			
			MacOS

		You need to get installed both XCode Developer Tools and CMake:

		#. The XCode Developer Tools

		   .. code-block:: bash

		   	$ xcode-select --install


		#. Download and install the appropriate `version of CMake <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_ for your Mac OSX.

	.. _cpp_desktop_win:
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title

			Windows

		To develop C/C++ programs in Windows you need:

		- `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_. Open Source tool that manages the software building process in a compiler-independent manner.

		- Compilers and build system. This could be one of the following (among other alternatives):

		   - `MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_ (make sure to include gcc, g++, and mingw32-make with your installation)
		   - Visual Studio C++


		These are the **steps for manual installation** of our recommended tools:

		1. Download and install CMake. You can `download the latest version of CMake here <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_.

		2. Download and install "base, g++" packages of MinGW. Follow `this link <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/>`_ to get the installer, and choose while installing two additional packages, GCC and G++ package.

		3. Add to your user ``PATH`` environment variable the paths to these tools. We recommend `Rapid Environment Editor <http://www.rapidee.com/>`_ for editing environment variables. Otherwise, go to **My Computer**, click **Properties**, click **Advanced System Settings** and in the System Properties window click the **Environment Variables** button. then you will see a new window and in **User Variables** you'll find the variable ``PATH``:

		   .. image:: /_static/img/cpp_windows_path.png

		Add your tools binaries folders (i.e. ``C:\MinGW\bin`` gor MiGW, and ``C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin`` for CMake).

		You might need to close and open again any ``cmd`` windows in order to load the new value for the ``PATH`` variable.


3. Verify your installation
---------------------------

Once you have installed the tools, **you should check they are working properly**. Open a terminal window and run the following commands. If the output messages look similar to these, the tools are successfully installed.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cmake --version
	cmake version [version]

.. code-block:: bash
	
	$ gcc --version
	gcc (GCC) [version]
	...

.. code-block:: bash
	
	$ g++ --version
	g++ (GCC) [version]
	...
	
.. code-block:: bash
	
	$ mingw32-make --version
	GNU Make [version]
	...
	
4. What to do next?
-------------------

You have successfully set up your system for developing C++ programs with biicode. These are some resources that will help you:

.. container:: todo
	
	* Read the :ref:`C/C++ getting started guide <hello_world>`. You'll learn how to create, build and execute your first biicode hive project.
	* Visit the :ref:`C/C++ examples section <cpp_examples>`.
	* Read the reference for :ref:`general biicode commands <biicode_reference>` and for :ref:`C/C++ specific biicode commands <cpp_reference>`
	* You can also `visit our forum and make any questions <http://forum.biicode.com/>`_.
