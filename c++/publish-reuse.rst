Upload and reuse code
=========================

So we have integrated in the previous step Google Test in our project, testing a simple **sum** function. Can I do the same with my source code? Of course, that is exactly what biicode does! 
The only requisite for this it that you have to |biicode_signup|. It is completely free, and it will just take two minutes.


.. |biicode_signup| raw:: html
   
   <span id="biicode_signup">
   <a href="https://www.biicode.com/accounts/signup" target="_blank">register an account</a>
   </span>
   <script type="text/javascript">
    mixpanel.track_links("#nav a", "ClickRegisterLink", {
        "referrer": document.referrer
    });
   </script>

1. Write reuseable code
-------------------------------------
In the previous example, we created folders **myuser/myblock**. Now we can replace **myuser** for the username we have used in the signup. In the examples we will use **maya** as the user name.

It is also a good idea to rename **myblock** for something more meaningful, lets imagine that we are building some mathematical functions, so we rename it with ""


Software good practices tell us that a good design for reusing our code later, would be having such a **sum** function separated in its own files:

**main.cpp**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include "google/gtest/gtest.h"
  #include "addition.h"
  TEST(Sum, Normal) {
    EXPECT_EQ(5, sum(2, 3));
  }
  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }


**adition.h**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #pragma once
  int sum(int a, int b);


**adition.cpp**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include "addition.h"
  int sum(int a, int b) {return a+b;}

The final layout should be:

.. code-block:: text

  +-- myproject
    |    +-- blocks
    |    |    +-- maya
    |    |    |    +-- math
    |    |    |    |    +-- main.cpp
    |    |    |    |    +-- addition.cpp
    |    |    |    |    +-- addition.h


Build with ``bii cpp:build`` and run your project again to check everything is ok.


2. Upload your code
-------------------------------------

Publishing your source code to biicode is simple:

.. code-block:: bash

   ~$ bii publish

This should upload your code to the servers, you can see it in your profile: **https://www.biicode.com/maya** (block math, version number 0)

You have published your code as DEV (one of the possible tags: DEV, ALPHA, BETA, STABLE) which means that such code is for your own development and testing. DEV publications are not freezed, they overwrite the last one, so you can delete, add, modify anything you want.


3. Reuse your code
-------------------------------------
Once your code is in biicode, you can reuse it in any project, even in a different computer. Let's create a new project to try it, lets imagine that we are building a calculator and we will reuse the already programmed **sum** function:


.. code-block:: bash

  ~$ bii init mycalc
  ~$ bii new maya/calc --hello cpp

And change the **main.cpp** file, with the following contents:

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <iostream>
  #include "maya/math/addition.h"

  using namespace std;
  int main() {
    cout<<"2 + 3 = "<< sum(2, 3)<<endl;
  }

In the "getting started" we used ``bii find`` to let biicode try to find a suitable (compatible) version of our dependencies. We can also directly specify which are our dependencies. In this example we depend on **maya/math**, and we only have one version (number 0). We can write in the **bii/requirements.bii** file:

.. code-block:: text

  maya/math: 0

After that, all you have to do is to build and your project:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~$ bii cpp:build
  ~$ bin/maya_calc_main
  2 + 3 = 5


.. container:: infonote

  Take one minute to look to your **deps** folder. You can see there your source code. And what about Google Test? Shouldn't be there? Not really. The **sum** function does not require Google Test at all, so Google Test is not required as dependency in your new calculator project (unless you also add it to define your own unit tests of this calculator, of course)


Congrats! You have just reused your **sum** function in a new project. You know that we are available at |biicode_forum_link| for any problems or feedback.
