Eclipse projects: "Launch failed. Binary not found" (OS X)
----------------------------------------------------------

If you are using **OS X** as development platform, you will need some aditional setup for executing your biicode projects within Eclipse IDE. It could happen that after building your project, you cannot execute the binaries from the IDE toolbar, getting the following error:

.. image:: /_static/img/c++/binary_not_found.png

If you are getting this error, please proceed as follows:

#. Right-click on your project and select *Properties*.
#. Select *C/C++ Make project* and click on the *Binary Parser* subsection tab.
#. Unselect Mach-O Parser (deprecated).
#. Select Mach-O 64 Parser.
#. Click *OK*.
