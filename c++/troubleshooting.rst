Eclipse projects: "Launch failed. Binary not found" (OS X)
----------------------------------------------------------

If you are using **OS X** as development platform, you will need some aditional setup for executing your biicode projects within Eclipse IDE. It could happen that after building your project, you cannot execute the binaries from the IDE toolbar, getting the following error:

.. image:: /_static/img/c++/binary_not_found.png

If you are getting this error, please proceed as follows:

#. Right-click on your project and select *Properties*.
#. Select *C/C++ Make project* and click on the *Binary Parser* subsection tab.
#. Unselect Mach-O Parser (deprecated).
#. Select Mach-O 64 Parser.
#. Click *OK*.

g++ doesn't compile simple code, using thread header
------------------------------------------------------

If you have a block that **links to pthread library** and you're using **Ubuntu 13.10 or 14.04**, you'll find this bug in g++ compiler:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ ./executable_file
	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::system_error'

**Create a CMakelists.txt inside your block that fails** and copy the following content:

**CMakeLists.txt**

.. code-block:: cmake

	#############BIICODE MACROS###################
	include(${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/biicode.cmake)
	INIT_BIICODE_BLOCK()

	ADD_BIICODE_TARGETS()
	#############################################

	set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wl,--no-as-needed")

Default Build Configuration with bii cpp:build not working
----------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the default configuration when installing biicode does not detect the compiler you are using, ``bii cpp:build`` does not work and it is necessary to configure your compiler with biicode.

.. container:: infonote
 
 **Windows Users**

 This could be a problem due to your path configuration. Please, check it out and :ref:`ensure everything is right <cpp_desktop_win>` to use the build configuration by default.

Type inside your project directory:

.. code-block:: bash
 
 $ bii cpp:configure -G "CMake generator name"

Building with bii cpp:build not working
---------------------------------------

Sometimes the default configuration when installing biicode does not detect the compiler you are using, ``bii cpp:build`` does not work and it is necessary to configure your compiler with biicode.

Type inside your project directory:

.. code-block:: bash
 bii cpp:configure -G "CMake generator name"
>>>>>>> a9e873b178173b2d148a3a9c01a8afa3d13f1cfc

If you want to check the generators available in your platform:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ cmake --help

To configure your project as default just type:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ bii cpp:configure -G "MinGW Makefiles"

Now doing ``bii cpp:build`` should work properly.
