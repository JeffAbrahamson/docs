What problem does it solve?
============================

We have proposed a :ref:`C++ challenge <c-challenge>`, some source files that have to be built and run (both the application and the test).

These source files have dependencies to 3 well known open source libraries, which are quite simple to integrate in any project:

* `Eigen Library <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org>`_ is headers-only.
* `CSparse  <http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/CSparse/>`_ is very simple, just a \*.h and some \*.c files
* `Google GTest <https://code.google.com/p/googletest/>`_ is also very portable, independent and prepared to be integrated in other projects.

The challenge consists in doing the task, from sources, in Win, Linux and Mac with the same setup.

Try it yourself and then solve the problem with biicode! (please proceed to Install and Get Started sections)
