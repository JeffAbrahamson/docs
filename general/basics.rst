Basic usage
===========

This section describes **the most common use cases that you will find when using biicode**. Biicode is a powerful tool that automates the resolution of code dependencies, project management, building, cross-compiling etc. To do so, it is able to analyze and understand your code, and find in our servers any missing dependencies. It is clear that all this process relies on two very important activities that are at the very basis of biicode philosophy: **sharing and reusing of source code**.

* Some people share their code, publishing their blocks, and uploading their source code to our servers. We analyze every single block, establishing all internal and external dependencies, and making them available to the rest of biicode users.
* Some people want to reuse that code. These are developers that have the need to reuse previously published version of their own blocks, or simply want to take advantage of the code shared by other users.

Biicode provides the tools for analyzing, publishing and reusing code and how to build or execute it. The basic commands of the :ref:`client binary<installation>` for these activites are explained in the following lines (a more detailed description of some of these commands can be found in the :ref:`commands reference<bii_commands>`):
