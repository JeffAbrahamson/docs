Configuration files
===================

Biicode offers you a set of configuration files across your workspace, hives, and blocks. These files empower you with full control of how biicode treats your code and dependencies. Some of these files were introduced in the :ref:`workspace and hives layouts section <layouts>`. They can be grouped in three main categories:

1. **Workspace-level configuration files**. They are contained in your workspace ``bii`` folder, and store general settings for all your hives:
	
	- Environment information in the ``environment.bii`` file. This file contains information about your system and preferences, which is used for generating particular hive settings.
	- Default policies for dependencies retrieval in the ``default_policies.bii`` file. This file is used as a templeate for new hives' policies, described bellow.
	- Default settings for file filtering in the ``ignore.bii`` file. Acts as a hierarchical configuration file across your hives and blocks, and this rules can be overriden or extended with other ``ignore.bii`` files located in deeper levels in the folders structure.
2. **Hive-level configuration files**, with ``.bii`` extension, contained in every hive ``bii`` folder. These are two files, and are created when executing the ``bii new`` command:
	
	- The ``settings.bii`` file, contains specific information about your hive: language, building and running tools, and predefined IDE. Its contents are generated using the workspace ``environment.bii`` file as a template.
	- The ``policies.bii`` file, which contains rules for downloading your dependencies (specifi branches and versions).

3. **Block-level configuration files**. These files allow a fine control of how biicode process and publishes your source blocks. Block configuration files can be grouped in two categories:

	- Files located inside the block ``bii`` folder. The block configuration ``bii`` folder is not created by default by the biicode client. However, you can create it by yourself (:ref:`see the hive layout <hive_layout>`) and include the following optional configuration files: ``dependencies.bii``, ``mains.bii``, ``virtual.bii``. The purpose of these files is described bellow.
	- Files located inside your block, but not inside your ``bii`` folder. These are files related with your code file types filtering settings: ``ignore.bii`` and ``types.bii``. As they are hierarchical configuration files (their contents apply to current and descendant folders files), theres is no sense in placing these files inside the block ``bii`` file, as it should not contain source code; just settings.


**All these configuration files are explained in detail in their corresponding subsections**:
