Raspberry Pi

It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video.

You can use biicode directly in it but we suggest setting using the cross compilation feature built in biicode.
Cross compilation only works in Linux at the moment so you can set up a virtual Linux machine or use the native rpi client.
