How to configure your biicode workspace
=======================================

If you haven't done so, you must first  :ref:`create a biicode workspace <create_workspace>`.

Add the cross compilers to biicode
----------------------------------

Add the cross compilers to **enviroment.bii** like shown in the last four lines: ::

	cpp:
	  builders:
	    - path: make
	      tool: {family: MAKE}
      compilers:
        - path: null
          tool: {family: GNU}
        - path: /user/local/tools/arm-bcm2708/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-gcc
          tool: {family: GNU, subfamily: C, arch: ARM}
        - path: /user/local/raspberry_pi/tools/arm-bcm2708/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-bcm2708hardfp-linux-gnueabi-g++
          tool: {family: GNU, subfamily: CPP, arch: ARM}
	
Create a new hive and code!
---------------------------

Creating a new hive with the ``bii new`` command.

Configure your settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update your settings.bii or default_settings with the info of your Raspberry Pi ::
	
	rpi: {directory: /home/pi, ip: 127.0.0.8, password: raspberry, user: pi}
	
* directory: Raspberry Pi directory where you want to save the files you send for scp
* ip: Raspberry Pi ip adress
* user: Raspberry Pi user name
* password: Raspberry Pi password

Change the architetucture of the cpp compiler on the settings.bii to ARM: ::

	cpp:
	  builder: {family: MINGW}
	  compiler: {arch: 32bit, family: MINGW}
	  configurer: {family: CMake}
	 
	(...)
	 
	cpp:
	  builder: {family: MINGW}
	  compiler: {arch: ARM, family: MINGW}
	  configurer: {family: CMake}

Code as usual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Copy the code that you want to compile into your ``block folder``. For example:

**hello.h**

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:

	#include  <iostream>
	using namespace std;
	 
	void hello(){
	 cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
	}

**main.cpp**

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:

	#include "hello.h"
	 
	int main() {
	  hello();
	  return 1;
	}

Compile your code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have completed all the coding process, you are ready to make the cross-compilation:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii cpp:build

Note that the ``bii cpp:build`` command needs to be executed from a folder containing a hive like any other biicode project. After some messages showing information about the compiling process, the binaries will created in your ``bin folder``.

Remember that when generating the binary by cross compilation, you can only run on the Raspberry Pi.

Send your binaries
------------------

To send your binary to Raspberry Pi, you just execute the ``rpi:send`` command and the file will be sent by scp to the address that appears in your **settings.bii**:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii rpi:send

	...
	
	Sending with scp -r [HIVE_DIRECTORY]/bin [RPI_USER]@[RPI_IP]:[DIRECTORY]/[HIVE_NAME]

	[RPI_USER]@[RPI_IP]'s password:

Finally, the Raspberry Pi user's password will be asked. If you have not changed your password, for raspbian is **raspberry**.

If you want to send files to another Raspberry Pi or specify a different directory that appears in your **settings.bii**, you have the option of passing these parameters to the ``bii:send``. These parameters are not obligatory, can be passed only a new directory and use the other parameters of **settings.bii**.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii rpi:send [directory] [user] [ip]
	
	...
	
	$ bii rpi:send [directory]
	
	

You just have to go to your Raspberry Pi and execute the binaries as any computer.
