Why biicode?
============

Biicode gives you several advantages for your Arduino experience. 

	1. You can **save your project in different folders** if you want a better organization. 
	2. You can **reuse other usersÂ´ code**. You could use, for example, an interesting PID code which you would want to add in your project.
	3. You have a very **simple** and **fast** way to **compile and upload** your code in your Arduino.
