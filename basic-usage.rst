Basic usage
===========

This section describes **the most common use cases that you will find when using Biicode with your hives**. Biicode is a powerfull tool that automates the resolution of code dependencies, downloading all needed missing files to your computer. To do so, it is able to analyze and understand your code, and find on our servers any missing dependencies. It is clear that all this process relies on two very important activities that are at the very basis of Biicode philosophy and purpose as a service: **sharing and reusing of source code**.

* Some people share their code, publishing their blocks, and uploading the source code to our servers. We analyze avery single block, establishing all internal and external dependencies, and making it available to other biicode users.
* Some people want to reuse that code. These are developers that have the need to reused previously published version of their own blocks, or simply want to take advantage of the code shared by other users.

Biicode provides the tools for analyzing, publishing and reusing code. The basic commands of the :ref:`client binary<installation>` for these activites are explained in the following lines (a more detailed description of some of these commands can be found in the :ref:`commands reference<bii_commands>`):
