Filefilter
---------------

The file below is the **Filefilter**. The information included in this file determines the types of files that you want to include in your Hive. ::

	# You can edit this file to add accepted and ignored file extensions
	# Configuration is up to down hierarchical so first rule matched is the one applied.
	#
	# Format is as follows:
	#     <rule>    <pattern>    <desired_extension>
	# rule: can be 'ACCEPT' or 'IGNORE'
	# pattern: conforms Unix Filename Pattern Matching
	# desired_extension: This indicates you'd like matched files to be treated
	#                    as if they had that extension. It can be left blank
	#
	# Example: Accept files without extension to be treated as c headers
	# ACCEPT    [!.]*    .h
