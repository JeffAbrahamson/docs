Filefilter
----------

The ``filefilter.bii`` file allows you to specify which files will be processed and published by the Biicode client program. The concept is similar to the ``.gitignore`` files in a git repository, and allows you to define which extensions will be processed by our service, and which ones will be excluded. However, in this case you must explicitly indicate which extensions must be included in your project, whitelisting them via appropriate configuration. 

Here you can see an example of the ``defaul_filefilter.bii`` file located in the ``bii`` folder in the root of your workspace (as you can see in :ref:`layouts section <layouts>`). ::

	# You can edit this file to add accepted and ignored file extensions
	# Configuration is up to down hierarchical so first rule matched is the one applied.
	#
	# Format is as follows:
	#     <rule>    <pattern>    <desired_extension>
	# rule: can be 'ACCEPT' or 'IGNORE'
	# pattern: conforms Unix Filename Pattern Matching
	# desired_extension: This indicates you'd like matched files to be treated
	#                    as if they had that extension. It can be left blank
	#
	# Example: Accept files without extension to be treated as c headers
	# ACCEPT    [!.]*    .h

	# Compiled source #
	IGNORE     *.com

This file defines a default set of files to be included in yout hives, and a set of excluded files (usual configuration and temporary files). However, it is up to you to modify this default configuration, or even include your own ``filefilter.bii`` inside the ``bii`` folder of your hives or blocks.

The previous file also shows the expected structure of each configuration line: ::

	ACCEPT|IGNORE <pattern> <desired_extension>

For example, if you want to use ``.ppm`` and ``.pgm`` images, you would have to add the following lines: ::

	ACCEPT   *.ppm
	ACCEPT   *.pgm

Even if for whatever reason, you decided to write C++ code in files with a ``.kk`` extension, you could indicate so to Biicode with the following line: ::

	ACCEPT   *.kk   *.cpp
