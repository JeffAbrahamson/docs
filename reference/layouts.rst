Workspace and hives layouts
===========================

This section describes the **folders structure of a typical biicode workspace**, and the hives it contains. If you haven't done so, we recommend reading these :ref:`basic biicode concepts <basic_concepts>` first, understandig the conceps of workspace, hive, block and cell.

Some special biicode configuration files are also mentioned. You can read in detail about these files in the :ref:`configuration files section <config_files>`.

.. _workspace_layout:

Workspace layout
----------------

A biicode workspace is :ref:`the special folder you initialize<create_workspace>` using the ``bii init`` command. It contains cached data from server, general information about your machine, system and tools, and default configurations for your hives. It is also the **container for all your hives** or working projects.

Every biicode workspace contains a special ``bii`` folder with **configuration files** holding information about your development environment and programming preferences.

The workspace layout is as follows: ::

|-- myworkspace
|    |-- bii
|    |    |-- .bii.db
|    |    |-- ignore.bii
|    |    |-- default_policies.bii
|    |    +-- environment.bii
|    +-- my_hive1
|    +-- my_hive2


As you can see there is a ``bii`` folder containing several files with ``.bii`` extension. These are global configuration files, and their contents affect all your hives.

* ``.bii.db``: is a local cache, that allows us to optimize dependencies retrieval for your hives. It contains information about previously downloaded dependencies, with the main purpose of accelerating future retrievals. You **must not edit or delete this file** under any circumstances.
* ``ignore.bii``: holds **default file filtering rules**. Its format is simmilar to a `.gitignore file <http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>`_, and indicates biicode **which files must be ignored** when processing and publishing your files. This configuration is applied hierarchically across all desdendant workspace folders, but can be overriden from any local block, creating custom specific configurations. :ref:`Learn more about ignore files following this link <ignore>`.
* ``default_policies.bii``: holds your workspace default `policies <http://docs.biicode.com/en/latest/reference/policies.html>`_ configuration. These policies define **how dependencies are found and which versions are retrieved** to your local filesystem. The contents of this file are copied to your hive's ``policies.bii`` configuration file whenever you create a new hive. You can think of this file as a template policies configuration for your new hives.
* ``environment.bii``: contains general **information about your development system and tools**, such as your operating system and installed compilers and IDEs. You can edit any tool path location if it is not present in your ``$PATH``. You can have, for instance, several IDEs defined in your environment. The contents of this file are eployed for generating specific settings for your hives.

As we already know, the workspace folder is :ref:`the top-level container for all your hives<basic_concepts>`. Every single hive in your workspace as also a predefined folders structure that mus be observed, which is described below.

.. _hive_layout:

Hives and blocks layout
-----------------------

A biicode workspace can hold **as many hives as you want**. Rememeber that a biicode hive is no other thing that a working project: a special folder that contains both your code and your code dependencies, and some custom configuration files, specific for that hive.

A typical hive layout is as follows: ::

|-- my_hive
|    +-- bii
|    |    |-- .hive.db
|    |    |-- settings.bii
|    |    |-- policies.bii
|    +-- bin
|    +-- blocks
|    |	  +-- my_user_name
|    |    |     +-- my_block
|    |    |     |     +-- bii
|    |    |     |     |    |-- dependencies.bii
|    |    |     |     |    |-- mains.bii
|    |    |     |     |    +-- virtual.bii
|    |    |  	|     |-- hello.c
|    |    |     |     +-- hello.h
|    |    |     +-- my_other_block
|    |    |   	      |-- foo.c
|    |    |           +-- bar.h
|    |    +-- other_user_name
|    |          +-- bii
|    |          |     |-- mains.bii
|    |          +-- block_im_editing
|    |        	      |-- message.c
|    |                +-- message.h
|    +-- build
|    +-- cmake
|    |    |-- CMakeLists.txt
|    |    |-- bii_functions.cmake
|    |    |-- bii_targets.cmake
|    |    +-- bii_vars.cmake
|    +-- deps

As you can see, the **hive** contains a collection of folders. We will go through each one of them:

* The ``bii`` folder presents a similar structure and contents to the :ref:`workspace bii folder <workspace_layout>`. It contains these files:

	* ``.hive.db``: contains all your hive meta information. This file must not be manually modified or removed.
	* ``policies.bii``: contains custom policies for a given hive. Its contents are copied from the workspace ``default_policies.bii`` file when :ref:`you create a new hive<bii_new_command>`.
	* ``settings.bii``: stores information about the hive programming language, operating system, and other tools required for a particular project. Its contents are extracted from the workspace environment configuration when you create a new hive.
* The ``bin`` folder contains any executables generated from hives containing programs in languages that must be compiled. You can safely delete its contents, as they will be generated with every new compilation.
* The ``blocks`` folder is very important, as it contains the **code of the blocks you are working on**; your source code. Code is listed under ``usernames/blockname``. In general, ``username`` will be your biicode user name. But in some cases you will be editing code originally created by other biicode user (see :ref:`how you can edit other users' blocks <bii_open_command>` with the ``bii open`` command). Under each ``username`` folder you can find all the blocks you are editing inside your hive. For version control systems, it is usually ok to ignore everything but this ``blocks`` folder, and the ``bii`` folder that holds the configuration and metadata.

	* ``bii``: Every block main contain its own configuration folder, with specific block-level settings and preferences. This folder and files are optional for a block, and not always needed. But sometimes you will need additional control over a block configuration:

		* ``dependencies.bii``: This optional file allows you to set extra dependencies for your project such as license files. You can read about :ref:`dependencies configuration here <dependencies_bii>`.
		* ``mains.bii``: Is another optional configuration file for defining entry points to your code. You can :ref:`read more about this file following this link <mains_bii>`.
		* ``virtual.bii``: This optional file is used to configure :ref:`virtual resources <virtual_cells>`; those whose actual file implementation depends on certain conditions.
* ``build``: Contains build files such as make scripts and compiled objects. You can safely delete it's contents
* ``cmake``: Contains autogenerated ``CMakeLists.txt`` as well as other files that allow you to define your own cmake.
* The ``deps`` folder contains your hive **dependencies source code**. All the code contained in the ``deps`` folder is automatically downloaded by the biicode client after analyzing your source files contained under the ``blocks`` folder. These are all the strictly necessary cells for your hive to compile (when needed, if your are using a compiled language as *c* or *c++*) and run correctly.
