The biicode client stopped working
----------------------------------

As biicode is a rapidly evolving technology —right now we are releasing new versions of the product at least weekly—, you may find that suddenly some features have stopped working as expected. 

C/C++ biicode projects in Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This problem affects to **Windows user that compile their C or C++ projects with MinGW** compilation tools. In this case, there is an issue if you have installed the Windows Shell Command Tool, ``sh.exe`` on your system. In this case, check if your ``PATH`` environment variable contains the ``sh.exe`` program, and if it does, remove it. To do so:

#. Right-click on *My Computer* icon, choose properties from the context menu. (Alternatively, you can double-click on the *System* icon in the *Control Panel*)

#. Now go to *Advaced System Settings* tab, click the *Enviroment Variables...* button and modify your ``PATH`` variable, removing the ``sh.exe`` route. 

If the problem persists, check other solutions proposed in this section, or `contact us at our forum <http://forum.biicode.com/category/client/windows>`__, and we'll try to solve your problem as soon as possible.

General solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If biicode client isn't working, this can be due to some update in the logic of our servers or in the client program we provide. If you are experiencing any difficulties with your local installation of biicode, try to **follow theses steps in order**:

#. First, try updating your biicode client `downloading the latest available release <https://www.biicode.com/downloads>`__.
#. Didn't that fix your problem? Then, from your **workspace folder**, execute the command ``bii clean``. That should remove all local information and force the client to update the local database.
#. If the two previous steps didn't solve the issue, try executing the command ``bii clean --cache``.

After these simple actions, everything should get back to normal. However, if your problem isn't solved yet, please `contact us at our forum <http://forum.biicode.com/category/client/>`__, and we'll try to provide a solution as soon as possible.
