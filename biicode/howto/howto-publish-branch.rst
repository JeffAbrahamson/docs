Publish branches
==================

To publish a branch is so simple. When you don't want to publish a version to ``master`` (default branch), only execute:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii publish --branch BRANCH_NAME

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii publish --branch develop

.. container:: infonote
