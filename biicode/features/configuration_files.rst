Configuration files
===================

Biicode offers you a set of configuration files across your projects and blocks. These files empower you with full control of how biicode treats your code and dependencies. Some of these files were introduced in the :ref:`project layout section <project_layout>`. 

**All these configuration files are explained in detail in their corresponding subsections**:
