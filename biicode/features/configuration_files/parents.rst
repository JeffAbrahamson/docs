.. _parents_bii:

parents.bii
===========

This file is **automatically created**, **when you publish a block**, inside the ``bii`` block folder ::

|-- my_project
|    +-- bii
|    +-- bin
|    +-- blocks
|    |	  +-- user25
|    |    |     +-- my_hello_block
|    |    |     |     +-- bii
|    |    |     |     |    |-- parents.bii
|    |    |  	|     |-- hello.c
|    |    |     |     |-- hello.h

It  provides insight about the origins of each of the blocks currently contained in the blocks folder of your project. 

For example, you have the above layout and you've already done your first publication, then your ``parents.bii`` would have the next content:

.. code-block:: text

	# This file contains your block ancestors versions
	* user25/my_hello_block: 0

What say us?

* Parent (previous publication to our editing block): ``user25/my_hello_block``
* Branch: ``master`` (in this case, it doesn't appear because it's the default branch)
* Version block: ``0``
|
Take a look at the asterisk, it indicates you who's your block parent.
Now, you decide to make a branch of this block named *my_pretty_branch*, and you have published two versions (versions 0 and 1), then your parents.bii would be like this:

.. code-block:: text

	# This file contains your block ancestors versions
	* user25/my_hello_block(my_pretty_branch): 1

It means:

* Parent: ``user25/my_hello_block`` 
* Branch: ``my_pretty_branch`` 
* Version block: ``1``
|
Finally, if you want to merge this branch to *master* branch, the parents.bii content would be:

.. code-block:: text

	# This file contains your block ancestors versions
	* user25/my_hello_block: 0
	user25/my_hello_block(my_pretty_branch): 1

So, information gives us is that ``user25/my_hello_block(my_pretty_branch):1`` (merge branch) has been merged to ``user25/my_hello_block(master):0`` (parent branch).
