Basic concepts & Commands
=========================

This section describes **the most common use cases that you will find when using biicode**. Biicode is a powerful tool that automates the resolution of code dependencies, project management, building, cross-compiling etc. To do so, it is able to analyze and understand your code, and find in our servers any missing dependencies. It is clear that all this process relies on two very important activities that are at the very basis of biicode philosophy: **sharing and reusing of source code**.

* Some people share their code, publishing their blocks, and uploading their source code to our servers. We analyze every single block, establishing all internal and external dependencies, and making them available to the rest of biicode users.
* Some people reuse code. These are developers reusing previously published versions of their own or other's code.

Biicode provides the tools for analyzing, publishing and reusing code and how to build or execute it. The basic biicode commands for these activities are explained in the following lines (a more detailed description of some of these commands can be found in the :ref:`commands reference <bii_commands>`):
