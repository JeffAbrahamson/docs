.. _virtual_bii:

The virtual.bii file
--------------------

The optional ``virtual.bii`` file, located inside the ``bii`` folder of your block, allows you to **define virtual resources** for that particular block. Virtual resources are an advanced feature that biicode offres you, to define platform-specific implementations for your files. In general, you can define the actual implementation for any given file via an appropriate python function, that implements some condition. 

You can :ref:`learn more about virtual resources following this link <virtual_cells>`.
