2. Raspbian installation
------------------------

First of all, you need a `Raspbian <http://www.raspbian.org/>`_ image running on your RPi board. The easiest path is to `download and install the New Out Of Box Software (NOOBS) provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation <http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads>`_.

Once you have installed the Raspbian distribution on your board, you are ready to start using biicode. After all, you have just installed a Linux distribution. So **you can work on your RPi board as with any other Linux** operating system. Check the :ref:`documentation for biicode C++ <cpp-index>` programming, :ref:`install the Linux C++ development tools <cpp_installation>`, and start programming!

However, **you can also work on your Linux desktop computer or laptop, and cross-compile your programs** for your RPi. This way the compilation process will be faster, and you can benefit from other advantages your usual development (Linux) environment provides. 

If you want to learn how biicode simplifies the cross-compiling process for your RPi board, :ref:`continue reading <rpi_cross_compiling>`!
