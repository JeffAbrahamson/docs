2. Raspbian installation
------------------------

Now, you need a `Raspbian <http://www.raspbian.org/>`_ image running on your RPi board. The easiest path is to `download and install the New Out Of Box Software (NOOBS) provided by the Raspberry Pi foundation <http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads>`_.

Once you have installed the Raspbian distribution on your board, you are ready to start using biicode. After all, you have just installed a Linux distribution. So **you can work on your RPi board as with any other Linux** operating system. Check the :ref:`documentation for biicode C++ <cpp-index>` programming, :ref:`install the Linux C++ development tools <cpp_installation>`, and start programming!

However, **you can also work on your Linux desktop computer or laptop, and cross-compile your programs** for your RPi. This way the compilation process will be faster, and you can benefit from other advantages your usual (Linux) development environment provides. 

If you want to learn how **biicode simplifies the cross-compiling process for your Raspberry Pi** board, :ref:`continue reading <rpi_cross_compiling>`!
