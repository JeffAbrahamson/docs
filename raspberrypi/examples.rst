========

In this section you will find some examples, showing the benefints of using biicode technology with your Raspberry Pi projects.

You can compile this projects directly on your Raspberry Pi, :ref:`using this setup <rpi_install_raspbian>`. However, for performance reasons, we suggest :ref:`using the cross compilation feature built in biicode <rpi_corss_compiling>`. Cross compilation only works in Linux at the moment.
