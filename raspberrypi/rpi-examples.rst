Examples
========

In this section you will find some examples, showing the benefints of **using biicode technology with your Raspberry Pi C++ projects**. All examples make use of well-known libraries, uploaded to the biicode platform and available for eveyone to use.

You can compile these projects directly on your Raspberry Pi. However, for performance reasons, we suggest using the cross compilation feature built in biicode. Cross compilation only works on Linux systems at this moment.
