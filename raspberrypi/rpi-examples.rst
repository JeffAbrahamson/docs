Examples
========

In this section you will find some examples, showing the benefints of **using biicode technology with your Raspberry Pi C++ projects**. All examples make use of well-known libraries, uploaded to the biicode platform and available for eveyone to use.

You can compile these projects directly on your Raspberry Pi, :ref:`using this setup <raspbian_installation>`. However, for performance reasons, we suggest :ref:`using the cross compilation feature built in biicode <rpi_cross_compiling>`. Cross compilation only works on Linux systems at this moment.
