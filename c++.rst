C/C++ Documentation
===================

**Biicode simplifies how you reuse C/C++ source code in your programs**.

   #. Reusing made easy: just ``#include`` the header file. No more copy and paste files from project to project or downloading and compiling external libraries.
   #. Great for rapid prototyping and trying out new libraries/versions.
   #. Smart management and finding of dependencies. We look for jointly compatible versions and allow full control of your dependencies
   #. Many `examples <http://docs.biicode.com/c++/examples.html>`_ to start now.
   #. Biicode uses **cmake**, if you know cmake you can `customize your builds <http://docs.biicode.com/c++/reference/cpp-build-files.html>`_, if you don't, biicode will automatically handle the builds for you.
