HTTP Server
===========

You can write and extend your own multi-platform http server with the `lasote/httpserver <https://www.biicode.com/lasote/blocks/lasote/httpserver/branches/master>`_ block.

How does it work?
-----------------

It allows you to just implement a subclass of httpserver::HttpMiddleware to attend browsers or other http client requests.

A method ``call`` from your subclass object will be called with a Request* object and a Response* object.

Just modify the body and/or headers of Response object in your method and the server will do all the work.


How can i use it?
-----------------

* Just copy the files contained in the following section to a new block.
* Find the dependencies and execute your code:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bii find
    $ bii cpp:run

* Open your web browser and go to *http://localhost:9000*

The code
--------

These are the files you will need in your block to have your HTTP Server up and running:

**main.cpp**. This file just instanciates the server and runs it with simple configuration parameters.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
        
    #include "lasote/httpserver/http_server.h"
    #include "my_http_middle_ware.h"
    
    using namespace httpserver;
    using namespace gip;
    
    int main(){
    
        MyHttpMiddleware my_mmiddleware;
        HttpServerConf conf(9000, 300, 60, 5);
    
        HttpServer http_server;
    
        http_server.run(&my_mmiddleware, &conf);
    
        return 0;
    
    }

**my_http_middle_ware.h**. Defines your HttpMiddleware subclass.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    #include "lasote/httpserver/http_middleware.h"

    using namespace httpserver;

    class MyHttpMiddleware : public httpserver::HttpMiddleware {
        public:
            MyHttpMiddleware() : HttpMiddleware(NULL){}
            MyHttpMiddleware(HttpMiddleware* other_middleware) : HttpMiddleware(other_middleware){
            }
            virtual ~MyHttpMiddleware();
            virtual void call(Request&, Response&);
    };


**my_http_middle_ware.cpp**. Implements HttpMiddleware subclass. You should implement the ``call`` method, reading the header variables from the request, and modifying the response to return the output.

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    #include "lasote/my_block/my_http_middle_ware.h"
    #include "sstream"
    #include "iostream"
    
    
    MyHttpMiddleware::~MyHttpMiddleware(){
    
    }
    
    void MyHttpMiddleware::call(Request& request, Response& response){
        ostringstream html;
    
        html << "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n";
    
        if(request.get("name") != ""){
            html << "Hello " << request.get("name") << "<br><br>";
        }
    
        //Build the html form
        string form;
        form = "\
                    <form name='form' action='/' method='POST'>\n\
                        Name: <br>\n\
                        <input type='text' name='name'> <br>\n\
                        <input type='submit''/>\n\
                    </form>\n\
                  ";
    
        html << form << "</body>\n</html>\n";
    
        // Set content type we are printing
        response.content_type("text/html");
        // Set the body
        response.body = html.str();
    }

Supported Operating Systems

The previous code has been tested on:

* Linux with GCC
* Windows with Mingw
* Windows with Visual Studio
* MacOS with Clang
