Gmock (Google C++ Mocking Framework)
=====================================

Google C++ Mocking Framework (or Google Mock for short) is a library for writing and using C++ mock classes. For more information about this library, visit their `official website <https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/>`_ or `wiki <https://code.google.com/p/googlemock/w/list>`_ 

You can find here the `Gmock biicode library site <https://www.biicode.com/google/blocks/google/gmock/branches/master>`_ .

The following example shows a simple use of gmock test. You can find this example and another ones in `google/gmocksamples <https://www.biicode.com/google/blocks/google/gmocksamples/branches/master>`_ .

You will see next console output after executing the command:
