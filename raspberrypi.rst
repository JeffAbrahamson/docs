Raspberry Pi Documentation
==========================

The `Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video.

Biicode allows you to exploit all these capacities with your own C++ programs.

Using biicode, you'll benefit from several advantages for your Raspberry Pi experience:

	1. Easy **Cross-compiling**, including support for OpenGL ES apps. 
	2. **Reuse yours and other users' code**. Code reusing is made easy; you only need to ``#include`` the file you need. Biicode automatically downloads all missing code, and builds your projects. No more copy and paste of code between projects!
	3. Biicode also provides **a simple way to send information and communicate via SSH** with your board.

In this part of the documentation you will find resources and tutorials for installing all necessary tools, create your first Raspberry Pi C++ project, examples, and technology reference.
