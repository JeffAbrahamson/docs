Node.js Documentation
=====================


`Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_ support is **experimental**. We’re playing and trying to fit our dependency management model
developed for C/C++ to the node.js ecosystem. If you’re curious about our technology you can easily
use it, but for production environments and real development we recommend to use the
standard approach with NPM package manager. Also, we’re open to suggestions and feedback, so if you
have some ideas, please `tell us <http://forum.biicode.com/category/nodejs>`_!
