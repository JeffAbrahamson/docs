Update your environment.bii
---------------------------

If you haven't done so, you must first :ref:`create a biicode workspace <create_workspace>`.

``IMPORTANT:`` You can only have one coding language for each Hive, so do not mix blocks with  Arduino and C/C++ Desktop apps.

Then you will see in your ``bii_workspace/bii`` folder the following **environment.bii** file with this default configuration:


.. code-block:: text
	:emphasize-lines: 1, 7, 8, 9

	arduino:
	  boards:
	  - {board: uno, no_autolibs: 'false', port: COM3, programmer: usbtinyisp}
	  builders:
	  - path: mingw32-make
		tool: {family: MINGW}
	  compilers:
	  - path: C:/Program Files/Arduino
		tool: {arch: AVR, family: MINGW, version: 1.0.5}
	  configurers:
	  - path: cmake
		tool: {family: CMake}


Change the ``compilers path`` in the environment if you have installed the Arduino Software in other folder. On the other side, you have the following tool info:

	* ``arch``: AVR
	* ``family``: MINGW
	* ``version``: 1.0.5

Don't forget to check you have the right version of your SDK. You can see your version in the file ``[Arduino_SDK_path]/revisions.txt``.
