Congure your port and board
===========================

I changed my Arduino's port, what happens now?
----------------------------------------------
Port detection is automatic, so whenever you execute ``bii arduino:upload`` the port is redetected.

Anyway, if you experience problems changing your port or your arduino board, just execute ``bii arduino:settings``


How can I change my Arduino project properties?
-----------------------------------------------

Execute ``bii arduino:settings`` and fill the requested info with the new data.
