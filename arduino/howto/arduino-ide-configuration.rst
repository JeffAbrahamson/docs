IDE configuration
=================

Biicode offers integration with `Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`_ for Arduino programmers. It is able to do the appropriate project setup on your behalf. This way you can work on your biicode project, using the underlying infrastructure and services provided by Eclipse.

This section details the steps you should follow to achieve this integration.

First of all, you need to configure your project for arduino and **Eclipse IDE for C/C++**:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ bii arduino:settings
	Introduce board: uno
	Arduino detected on port COM14
	$ bii arduino:configure -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
	...
	A new Eclipse project has been generated for you.
	Open eclipse, select "File > Import > General > Existing project into Workspace"and select folder "YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER"


<<<<<<< HEAD
If you have configured your project settings as in the previous example, your are ready to import your project into the Eclipse IDE. It is important that you use a version of Eclipse that contains the C/C++ Toolkit. So we recommend using `Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`_.
=======
Depending on your OS and desired compiler you can use different Eclipse generators:

* **"Eclipse CDT4 - MinGW Makefiles"** Generate with MinGW Makefiles.
* **"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"** Generate with Unix Makefiles.

Now your are ready to import your project into the Eclipse IDE. It is important that you use a version of Eclipse that contains the C/C++ Toolkit. So we recommend using `Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`_.

How to import your project
--------------------------

#. From the main Eclipse menu choose: *File > import...*
#. Now, select *general > Existing Projects into Workspace*, and clic next.
#. Select the root directory as the **root folder of your project**.
#. You should see a project already selected in the *projects* box. Click *finish*.

If you want to add new files to your block, just right-click on the folder of your block and create a new file.

**Note:** If you add new dependencies to your project you'll need to manually invoke ``bii find``.

You can build your application in *Project > Build project* if you don't have automated builds set.

If you are using **Mac** as developing platform, you will need some aditional setup:

#. Right-click on your project and select *Properties*.
#. Select *C/C++ Make project* and click on the *Binary Parser* subsection tab.
#. Unselect Mach-O Parser (deprecated).
#. Select Mach-O 64 Parser.
#. Click *OK*.

And this is all you need to work as usual with the Eclipse IDE.
