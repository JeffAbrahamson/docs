Arduino
=======
``IMPORTANT:`` You can only have one language for Hive, so do not mix blocks with  Arduino and C/C++ Desktop apps.

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.


**Why biicode?**

	1. **Save your project in different folders** for a better organization. 
	2. **Reuse yours and other usersÂ´ code**. Reuse make easy, just #include the file you need and you get it. No more copy and paste files from project to project.
	3. This is a very **simple** and **fast** way to **compile and upload** your code in your Arduino.
