Install Arduino tools manually 
------------------------------

This section describes **how to configure your system for Arduino programs with biicode.**

First, try the automatic installation provided by biicode. Only if something goes wrong, proceed with the manual installation described at the end of this section.

1 Automatic installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Just execute** ``bii setup:arduino`` in your console and all needed tools will be installed automatically.

		.. code-block:: bash

		   $ bii setup:arduino

Type the previous command and follow the instructions. You might need to close your console and open a new one to reload the updated environment variables. In the new console window, re-run the ``bii setup:arduino`` command to verify everything is properly installed.

**If something fails with the automatic installation**, please `contact us at our forum <http://forum.biicode.com/category/arduino>`__, and feel free to ask any questions. Then, **proceed with the alternative manual installation** described bellow.


2. Manual installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the manual installation of Arduino tools. You only need to go through this section if something failed during the automatic installation explained before. If you experience any issues during this manual installation, please `contact us at our forum <http://forum.biicode.com/category/arduino>`__, and we'll try to solve your problem as soon as possible.

2.1. Install the development tools
..................................

In order to configure and compile your Arduino projects with biicode, you need to install some additional tools. CMake is an open source tool that manages the software building process in a compiler-independent manner. Select your operating system bellow, and follow the instructions.

.. container:: tabs-section
	
	.. _arduino_cmake_linux:
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title
			
			Linux

		Install the required development tools as root:

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake

		That's all!

	.. _arduino_cmake_mac:
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title
			
			MacOS

		You need to get installed both XCode Developer Tools and CMake:

		#. The XCode Developer Tools

		   .. code-block:: bash

		   	$ xcode-select --install


		#. Download and install the appropriate `version of CMake <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_ for your Mac OSX.

	.. _arduino_cmake_win:
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title

			Windows

		1. Download and install CMake. You can `download the latest version of CMake here <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>`_.

		3. Add to your user ``PATH`` environment variable the path to CMake. We recommend `Rapid Environment Editor <http://www.rapidee.com/>`_ for editing environment variables. Otherwise, go to **My Computer**, click **Properties**, click **Advanced System Settings** and in the System Properties window click the **Environment Variables** button. then you will see a new window and in **User Variables** you'll find the variable ``PATH``:

		   .. image:: /_static/img/cpp_windows_path.png

		Add CMake binaries folders (i.e. ``C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin``).

		You might need to close and open again any ``cmd`` windows in order to load the new value for the ``PATH`` variable.


Now, you can check CMake is working properly. Open a terminal window and run the following command. If the output message looks similar to this, CMake is successfully installed.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cmake --version
	cmake version [version]

2.2. Install Arduino software
.............................

You need to `download the Arduino software <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>`_ first, it is important to choose a SDK compatible with your board. If you need more info visit the `official Arduino website <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>`_.

You must install the SDK in the following path.

.. container:: tabs-section
	
	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title
			
			Linux

		.. code-block:: text

			/usr/share/arduino

	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title
			
			MacOS

		.. code-block:: text
		
			/Applications/Arduino.app

	.. container:: tabs-item

		.. rst-class:: tabs-title

			Windows

		.. code-block:: text
			
			C:/Program Files(x86) /Arduino
