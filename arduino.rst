Arduino Documentation
=====================

`Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc/>`_ is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

In this context, biicode technology gives you several advantages for enriching your Arduino experience:

	1. **Save your project in different folders** for a better organization. 
	2. **Reuse yours and other usersÂ´ code**. Reuse make easy, just #include the file you need and you get it. No more copy and paste files from project to project.
	3. This is a very **simple** and **fast** way to **compile and upload** your code in your Arduino.

Here you will learn how to set up your system, and create your first Arduino project with biicode.
