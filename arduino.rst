Arduino Documentation
=====================

`Arduino <http://www.arduino.cc/>`_ is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

In this context, biicode technology gives you several advantages for enriching your Arduino experience:

	1. **Save your project in different folders** for a better organization. 
	2. **Reuse yours and other userÂ´s code**. Reusing made easy: just ``#include`` the file you need and you get it. No more copy and paste files from project to project or dowloading zip files from tutorials.
	3. This is a **simple** and **fast** way to **compile and upload** your code in your Arduino.
	4. You can use the text editors of your choice, also we provide **Eclipse integration**.
	5. We are hosting `adafruit <https://www.biicode.com/adafruit>`_, `sparkfun <https://www.biicode.com/sparkfun>`_ and `many other libraries <https://www.biicode.com/search?words=arduino&search=Search>`_, **you won't need to download and install libraries in your SDK anymore**.

Here you will learn how to set up your system, and create your first Arduino project with biicode.
