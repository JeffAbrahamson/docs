Biicode BETA
=============

Biicode is now in an early Beta stage but we are already open, also we have many users that are giving us a lot of feedback that we have to process and further improve the usability of the system. We are doing our best to quickly attend our current users feedback.

Biicode has many core innovations, and we are following the lean startup and MVP paradigms, i.e. we try to release very often and quickly and perform fast iterations on user feedback. However,  this also means that much functionality you could expect is not as intuitive as you would desire, and errors and failures could arise often, specially on last features. New features are probably on the way, maybe even implemented but not yet properly documented. Moreover, commands, processes etc. are likely to change in the short term.
