First Steps
===========

This section describes the **first basic steps that are mandatory in order to use the biicode technology on any computer**, regardless the target platform (desktop, raspberry Pi, Arduinoâ€¦) or operating system.

1. Sign up
----------

First of all, `sign up in our biicode website <https://www.biicode.com/accounts/signup>`_ and get your own user account. It will take you less than 1 minute!

.. _download_client_binaries:

2. Download the client binaries
-------------------------------

Now, `download the appropriate client binaries for your development platform <https://www.biicode.com/downloads>`_, execute the setup program and follow the instructions.

**Biicode is an evolving technology**, and many modifications and improvements are introduced weekly with our releases. Rememeber to check frequently for new versions of the client, consult the :ref:`ChangeLog <changelog>`, and **make sure you are not using a deprecated version** reading our :ref:`upgrading section <upgrading>`.

.. container:: infonote

    **Alternative install for Debian based distributions (Ubuntu, Raspbian)**


    You can use the ``apt-get`` program for installing biicode using our APT repository:

    Quick install: 

    .. code-block:: bash

        wget http://apt.biicode.com/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh


    Step by step install:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # 1. Add this line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file
        deb http://apt.biicode.com/debian/ stable non-free
        
        # 2. Add our public key executing:
        wget -qO- http://apt.biicode.com/packages.biicode.key | sudo apt-key add -
        
        # 3. Execute apt-get update:
        sudo apt-get update 
        
        # 4. Execute apt-get install: 
        sudo apt-get install biicode

	
3. Choose your development tool
----------------------------------

Then you'll need to set up the development tools you're going to use as described in :ref:`development tools installation <desktop_installation>`, select it and go to the final step.


.. _create_workspace:

4. Create your first workspace
------------------------------

The first step is creating your own **biicode workspace**. This is the place where all your hives will be located. In general, this step needs to be done only once after the initial setup.

**NOTE:** Please **avoid creating biicode workspaces in paths with spaces or colons ':'**.

This example is created by a biicode user named "phil", you will have to enter the user name and password which you have chosen in the *Sign up* step:

.. raw:: html

	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/7621.js" id="asciicast-7621" async data-speed="2"></script>

As you can see, it's possible to set a default programming language as well as a default IDE. Now you have created the biicode workspace that will contain all your code!
