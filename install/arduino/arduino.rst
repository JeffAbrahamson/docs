Arduino development tools install
============================================

Download the Arduino Software
---------------------------------
You need to `download the Arduino software <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>`_ first, it is important to choose a SDK compatible with your board. If you need more info visit the `official Arduino website <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>`_.

``Windows Users``: **Install** the Arduino software into **C:/Program Files/Arduino** and not into C:/Program Files/Arduino (x86). It is important because some CMake versions can not interpret correctly this path.

Install CMake & Mingw
